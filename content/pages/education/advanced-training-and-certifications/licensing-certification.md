VA may pay Veterans back for licensing or certification exam costs.

<div class="call-out" markdown="1">

### Can I get paid back for licensing and certification test fees?
Yes, if:

  -	You qualify for the GI Bill.
  -	You're taking an exam that costs less than $2,000.

### Who is covered?
Veterans

</div>

### What kind of benefits can I get?
VA may pay you back for tests that you need to take to become a licensed or certified mechanic, medical technician, attorney, therapist, website developer, computer network engineer, or other professional.

### How do I get this benefit?
After you turn in proof of payment, VA may pay you back. There's no limit to the number of tests you can take, or the number of times you take the same test. We pay for tests even when you donâ€™t score high enough to get your license or certification.

VA won't pay for fees or costs you need to pay to get your license or certification.
