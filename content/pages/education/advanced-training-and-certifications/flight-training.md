</div>

### What benefits can I get? 

- Under [the Montgomery GI Bill](/education/gi-bill/montgomery-active-duty/) (MGIB) or [Reserve Educational Assistance Program (REAP)](/education/other-educational-assistance-programs/reap/), we pay you back for part of flight training costs at an approved pilot school. 

- Under the [Post-9/11 GI Bill](/education/gi-bill/post-9-11/), we pay the pilot school the full cost of your flight training, up to a yearly limit (in proportion to your level of eligibility). If flight training is part of your college degree at an approved college or university, we pay the required tuition and fees, a monthly housing allowance, and a books and supplies stipend. If you're enrolled in a vocational flight training program you can be paid back the lesser of the full cost of training or the annual maximum amount of training. [Review the rate tables](http://www.benefits.va.gov/gibill/resources/benefits_resources/rate_tables.asp). [Find out more about the Post-9/11 GI Bill](/education/gi-bill/post-9-11/).

- If you use the Post-9/11 GI Bill, your payment depends on what flight course you take and what type of school you attend.
    - If your school is a standalone Part 141 pilot school, we pay the school for the full cost of training up to a yearly limit*. See the [annual maximum amount](http://www.benefits.va.gov/gibill/resources/benefits_resources/rate_tables.asp).
    - If your school is a public college or university, we reimburses the school the full cost of tuition and fees*. 
    - If your school is a private college or university, we reimburse the school the full cost of tuition and fees.*

*Your level of eligibility and remaining entitlement will limit the payment amount.
