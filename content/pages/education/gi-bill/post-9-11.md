If you're interested in education or training opportunities and you've served on active duty after September 10, 2001, you may qualify for the Post-9/11 GI Bill. The Post-9/11 GI Bill is the largest expansion of education benefits since the Montgomery GI Bill.

<div class="call-out usa-content" markdown="1">

### Can I get education benefits?

You can get education benefits if you meet the basic requirements for any GI Bill program, and 
-  You've served on active duty for at least 90 days, whether continuous or interrupted, after September 10, 2001.

If you're eligible for more than 1 VA education benefit, you may be asked to pick which one you want to use. This is an irrevocable decision, meaning you can't change your mind. 

### Who's covered?

Veterans
Qualified dependents

</div>

### What benefits can I get? 

- Tuition and fees
- Money for housing (for those attending more than half time)
- Money for books and supplies (up to $1,000 per academic year)

-------

### How do I get these benefits?

You'll need to apply. [Apply for education benefits](/education/apply-for-education-benefits/). The benefit amount depends on where you use the benefit, the amount of your active-duty service since September 10, 2001, and how many credits or training hours you're taking.

#### The program

- Covers the entire in-state tuition for state schools and up to the national maximum ($21,084.89) for private or foreign schools.
- Pays qualified Veterans or dependents a Basic Allowance for Housing (BAH) based on the cost of living for the specific location of your school.

**Example:** If you were attending University of California, Los Angeles, in 2015 (at the 100% benefit level, while attending school full time), you would get a BAH of up to $2,433 a month while in school. If you were attending the University of Virginia in Charlottesville, you would get up to $1,638 while in school.

- Provides up to 36 months of education benefits, generally payable for 15 years following your release from active duty
- Uses a percentage-of-maximum-benefit scale based on how much active service you have had since September 10, 2001

**Example:** If you had 90 days of active service since September 10, 2001, you would qualify for 40% of the maximum amount. Three years of active service would qualify you for 100% of the benefit.

#### Other potential benefits

- The Yellow Ribbon Program may provide additional money to cover higher private-school and out-of-state tuition and fees.
- The Transfer of Entitlement option enables eligible Servicemembers to transfer all 36 months or a portion of Post-9/11 GI Bill benefits to a spouse or children. Transfer eligibility is determined by the Department of Defense.
