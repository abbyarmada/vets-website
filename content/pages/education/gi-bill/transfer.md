Find out if you can transfer any of your unused Post-9/11 GI Bill benefits to your spouse or dependent children.

**Note:** The Department of Defense (DOD) determines whether or not you can transfer benefits to your family.

### Can I transfer benefits?
You can transfer benefits if you’re on active duty or in the Selected Reserve, and:
  - You’re in one of these situations:
     - You have at least 6 years of service on the date of approval and agree to serve 4 additional years from the date of election, **or**
     - You have at least 10 years of service on the date of approval, are prevented by either policy or statute from committing to 4 additional years, but agree to serve for the maximum amount of time allowed, **and**
  - The person getting benefits is enrolled in the Defense Enrollment Eligibility Reporting System (DEERS).

### Who's covered?
Qualified dependents
</div>

### What benefits can they get?

If the DOD approves the transfer, your spouse or dependent children can apply for up to 36 months of benefits, and may be able to get money for: 

- Tuition
- Housing
- Books and supplies


------

### When can they use the transferred benefit?

The following conditions apply to family members using transferred benefits:

#### Spouses

- May use the benefit immediately.
- May use the benefit while you're on active duty or after separation.
- Aren't eligible for the monthly housing allowance while you're on active duty.
- May use the benefit for up to 15 years after your separation from active duty.

#### Children

- May start to use the benefit only after you've completed at least 10 years of service.
- May use the benefit while you're on active duty or after separation.
- May not use the benefit until they've gotten a high school diploma (or equivalency certificate), or have reached 18 years of age.
- Are entitled to the monthly housing allowance stipend even when you're on active duty.
- Don't have to use the benefit within 15 years after your separation from active duty, but they can't use the benefit after they've turned 26 years old.


Dependent eligibility isn't affected if a child marries or if you and your spouse divorce. However, Servicemembers and Veterans can revoke or change a transfer at any time. If you want to totally revoke transferred benefits for a dependent and you're still in the service, you must turn in another transfer request for the dependent through milConnect. If a dependent’s transfer eligibility was previously totally revoked, you can't transfer benefits again to that dependent.


### How do I transfer the benefit?

While you're still active duty, request to transfer modify, or revoke a Transfer of Entitlement (TOE) through milConnect. [Request a transfer](https://www.dmdc.osd.mil/milconnect/). You can't apply for a transfer of benefits through VA. 

If the TOE is approved, family members should apply for benefits. [Apply online for benefits](https://www.ebenefits.va.gov/ebenefits/vonapp). They may also print, fill out, and mail VA Form 22-1990e to the nearest VA regional office. [Download Form 22-1990e](http://www.vba.va.gov/pubs/forms/VBA-22-1990e-ARE.pdf). [Find a nearby VA facility](/facilities/)

Once you leave active duty, you can still provide a future effective date for the use of the TOE, modify the number of months transferred, or revoke the transfer of entitlement by submitting a written request to VA through milConnect.
