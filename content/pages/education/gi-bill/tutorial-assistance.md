### How do I get this benefit?

VA will not pay more than $100 per month for tutoring assistance, and will not pay more than $1,200 total. Here's how the process works:

- Your course instructor must confirm your need for a tutor and write a letter on your behalf. The instructor should send the letter to your school's certifying official and add a copy to your VA student file.
- If the school approves your need, the school will assign you a tutor and confirm the tutor’s hourly pay.
- After you get tutoring, you, your selected tutor, and your school’s certifying official must complete and sign the [Application for Individualized Tutorial Assistance](http://www.vba.va.gov/pubs/forms/vba-22-1990t-are.pdf) (VA Form 22-1990t). If you're using the Post-9/11 GI Bill, your instructor must also sign section 18 of this form.
- It must be signed and dated on or after the date of the last certified tutoring session (Form 22-1900t, item 12b).

There is no entitlement charge for the first $600 of your [Montgomery GI Bill](/education/gi-bill/) or for your [Post-9/11 GI Bill](/education/gi-bill/post-9-11/) or [Dependents’ Educational Assistance](/education/gi-bill/survivors-dependent-assistance/dependents-education/).

**Note:** Tutorial Assistance is not available for Reservists using the Reserve Educational Assistance Program (REAP) benefit.
