### How do I get this benefit?

- Your course instructor must confirm your need for a tutor and write a letter on your behalf. The instructor should send the letter to your school's certifying official and add a copy to your VA student file.
- If the school approves your need for a tutor, the school will assign you a tutor and confirm the tutor’s hourly pay.
- After you get tutoring, you, your selected tutor, and your school’s certifying official must complete and sign the Application for Individualized Tutorial Assistance (VA Form 22-1990t). If you're using the Post-9/11 GI Bill, your instructor must also sign section 18 of this form. [Download Form 22-1990t](http://www.vba.va.gov/pubs/forms/vba-22-1990t-are.pdf).
- It must be signed and dated on or after the date of the last certified tutoring session (Form 22-1900t, item 12b).

If you're using the Montgomery GI Bill (MGIB), you can get up to $600 before your benefits will be charged. 
If you're using the Post-9/11 GI Bill or Dependents’ Educational Assistance (DEA), your GI Bill benefits won't be charged.

**Note:** This benefit isn't available for Reservists using the Reserve Educational Assistance Program (REAP) benefit.
