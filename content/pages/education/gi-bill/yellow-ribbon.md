The Yellow Ribbon Program can help you pay for higher out-of-state, private, or graduate school tuition that the [Post-9/11 GI Bill](/education/gi-bill/post-9-11/) doesn't cover.

### Can I get this benefit?
You can if you qualify for the [maximum benefit rate under the Post-9/11 GI Bill](https://www.vets.gov/education/gi-bill/post-9-11/) and:
  - Your school voluntarily participates in the [Yellow Ribbon Program](http://www.benefits.va.gov/GIBILL/yellow_ribbon/yrp_list_2015.asp ), **and**
  - You served an combined period of 36 months on active duty after September 10, 2001, **and**
  - You were honorably discharged from active duty for a service-connected disability with at least 30 continuous days after September 10, 2001. 

You can get this benefit if you're the dependent of a Veteran eligible for [transfer of entitlement for the Post-9/11 GI Bill](https://www.vets.gov/education/gi-bill/transfer/).

</li>

<li class="step three">
<div markdown="1">

##### Wait for a decision

###### Your school will determine:
  -  Whether it has already enrolled the maximum number of participants for the program period. Enrollment is on a first-come, first-served basis. Your school and VA agree on how many students may be covered each year.
  -  How much the entitlement will be. This is calculated by adding up tuition and mandatory fees, and then subtracting any specific aid you’ve received from other sources such as scholarships or grants as well as your Post-9/11 GI Bill tuition payment. Your school applies the Yellow Ribbon Program benefit to this final amount.
