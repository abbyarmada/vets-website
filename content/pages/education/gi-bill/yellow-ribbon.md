If your school participates in the Yellow Ribbon Program, you may be able to lower or eliminate your education costs that aren't covered by the [Post-9/11 GI Bill](/education/gi-bill/post-9-11/index.html), such as higher tuition at private colleges or out-of-state schools.

### Can I get this benefit?
You can if you are a Veteran or the dependent of a Veteran who qualifies for transfer of entitlement for the Post-9/11 GI Bill, or you're the child of an active-duty Servicemember who is the recipient of a transfer of entitlement, and:
  - You're eligible to get 100% of your Post-9/11 GI Bill benefits. [Is this me?](https://gibill.custhelp.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/947)
  - Your school participates in the [Yellow Ribbon Program for the 2015-16 school year](http://www.benefits.va.gov/GIBILL/yellow_ribbon/yrp_list_2015.asp ), **and**
  - You maintain continuous enrollment, full- or part-time, as defined by your school, **and**

</li>

<li class="step three">
<div markdown="1">

##### Wait for a decision

###### Your school will determine:
  -  Whether it has already enrolled the maximum number of participants for the program period. Enrollment is on a first-come, first-served basis. Your school and VA agree on how many students may be covered each year.
  -  How much the entitlement will be. This is calculated by adding up tuition and mandatory fees, and then subtracting any specific aid you’ve received from other sources such as scholarships or grants as well as your Post-9/11 GI Bill tuition payment. Your school applies the Yellow Ribbon Program benefit to this final amount.
