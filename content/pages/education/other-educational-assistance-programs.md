Guardsmen, Reservists, and Veterans who don't qualify for the Post-9/11 GI Bill can apply for education benefits through the post-Vietnam Era Veteransâ€™ Educational Assistance Program (VEAP, Chapter 32), the Montgomery GI Bill Active Duty (MGIB-AD, Chapter 30), the Montgomery GI Bill Selected Reserve (MGIB-SR, Chapter 1606), and the National Call to Service program. [Apply for benefits](/education/apply-for-education-benefits/).

An accredited representative (a trained professional trusted to help with VA-related claims) who works with a Veteran Service Organization (VSO) can help you pick the right program. [Get help from an accredited representative](https://www.va.gov/ogc/apps/accreditation/index.asp).
