You can use VA education benefits at some but not all schools. Find out which schools we've approved with the [school search tool](http://inquiry.vba.va.gov/weamspub/buildSearchInstitutionCriteria.do;jsessionid=qtMbSxQFpzyL7GpnQrtnNGv6G9CGQQvb2YqM9Cvw3vB2pv2lXhfJ!-1531379871). You can also find institutions of higher education that take part in the [Yellow Ribbon Program](/education/gi-bill/yellow-ribbon/), which can help you pay for school costs not covered by the Post-9/11 GI Bill. 

The GI Bill Comparison tool shows you what benefits you'll get at different schools. [Use the GI Bill Comparison Tool](/gi-bill-comparison-tool/).
