In addition to career counseling through VA, you can use CareerScope, a tool that helps you figure out what you're interested in and what you're good at. If you're a Veteran, Servicemember, or dependent, CareerScope can help you decide what civilian career path to take. [Get started with CareerScope](https://va.careerscope.net/gibill). 

After you answer some questions, CareerScope will give you suggestions for careers and fields you may enjoy and in which you'll probably do well. CareerScope also recommends courses or training programs that can help you go after those careers.

Use this [Report Interpretation guide](http://www.benefits.va.gov/gibill/docs/job_aids/CareerScope_Report_Interpretation.pdf) to help you understand your CareerScope results.
