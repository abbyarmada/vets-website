With co-op training, you can get full-time work experience in between periods of going to school full time. If you're enrolled at an approved Institution of Higher Learning (IHL) and you're part of a co-op training program, we may cover some of your costs.

### How do I get these benefits?

The amount we cover depends on the benefit you use.

- **The Post-9/11 GI Bill:** If the program is at a public IHL, we pay the actual costs for public in-state tuition and fees. If the program is at a private or foreign IHL, we pay the lesser of the national maximum or the actual costs for in-state tuition and fees. We also pay for some of the cost of housing and books.
- **All other GI Bill programs:** We pay a monthly rate that depends on which GI Bill program you qualify for.
