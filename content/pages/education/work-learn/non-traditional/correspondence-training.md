If you'd like to learn at home or are located in a remote area, correspondence training may be a good option for you. This type of training doesn't have to be completed within a quarter, semester, or term. You get coursework assignments in the mail and send them back when completed.

### What benefits can I get? 

You may be paid back for the cost of classes 

### How do I get these benefits? 

You'll need to apply for benefits. [Apply for education benefits](/education/apply-for-education-benefits/). Payment amounts are based on the specific GI Bill program you are using. If you're enrolled in correspondence training, VA determines your payment amount and pays it quarterly after getting certification from the school that you completed your lessons.

For Post-9/11 GI Bill recipients, VA reimburses the actual costs of the school’s in-state tuition and fees, up to the maximum amount allowed by law. View the [current payment rates](http://www.benefits.va.gov/gibill/resources/benefits_resources/rate_tables.asp). For all other GI Bill recipients, VA reimburses 55% of the approved costs.
