### How do I get these benefits?

You'll need to apply for benefits. [Apply for education benefits](/education/apply-for-education-benefits/). The amount you get will depend on which GI Bill program you use and the school you attend. VA pays you at the end of each month for the hours you have spent training, and gives you a monthly housing allowance based on the location of the school. 

**Post-9/11 GI Bill:** For training offered at non-degree schools, VA pays for in-state tuition and fees up to the national maximum. 
**Other GI Bill programs:** VA pays a monthly rate that depends on your specific program and your length of active service.
