<ol class="process">
<li class="step one">

<div markdown="1">

##### Prepare

- Get help from an accredited representative if you need it. [Find an accredited representative](/disability-benefits/apply-for-benefits/help/index.html).
- Find out what kind of supporting documents (or evidence) you'll need to send in along with your claim. [See evidence requirements](/disability-benefits/claims-process/evidence/).
- Be sure your claim is filled out completely and that you've included all supporting documents. This will help us process your claim quickly. [Learn more about fully developed claims](/disability-benefits/claims-process/claim-types/fully-developed-claim/).

###### Documents you’ll need

For the first disability claim you send us, please provide:

[Order service records through the National Archives](https://www.archives.gov/veterans/military-service-records/).

</div>

</li>

<li class="step three">

<div markdown="1">

##### VA Review

###### How long will it take for VA to review my claim?
The amount of time it takes to review your claim depends on:

- The type of claim you filed 
- How many injuries or disabilities you claimed and how complex they are
- How long it takes us to collect the evidence needed to decide your claim

</div>


<div class="feature" markdown="1">

###### What happens after I file my claim?

1. We receive your claim. (Claim status: **Claim Received**)
2. A Veterans Service Representative (VSR) looks at your claim to figure out if we need any more information to make a decision. (Claim status: **Under Review**)
3. If we need more information, the VSR asks you for it or asks other governmental agencies for it on your behalf. (Claim status: **Gathering of Evidence**)
4. Once we get—or we've tried to get—all the information we need, the VSR makes sure each issue claimed is ready for a decision.
(Claim status: **Review of Evidence**)
5. The VSR electronically sends your claim and supporting documents to a Rating Veterans Service Representative (RVSR) for a final decision. (Claim status: **Preparation for a Decision**)

</div>

<div markdown="1">

###### What if VA needs more information?

- We may reach out on your behalf to other governmental agencies (like the Department of Defense) for records.
- If we need more medical information, we may ask you for it. We may also schedule a VA claim exam (also known as a C&P exam) to get more information about the disabilities you claimed.

**Note:**  We may schedule you for 1 or more exams based on the number and type of disabilities claimed.

###### Do I need to do anything while I’m waiting?

Not unless you hear from us. You don't need to do anything else unless we send you a letter asking for more information. If we schedule any exams for you, be sure not to miss them.

</div>

</li>

<li class="step last four">

<div markdown="1">

##### Decision

- The RVSR decides your claim after reviewing all evidence in your record (including your application, VA claim exam reports, and service treatment records).
- After deciding the claim, the RVSR sends it to a VSR to record the decision and write the decision notice (the letter you'll get about your claim decision).
- A Senior Veterans Service Representative (SVSR) reviews the completed documents, then approves release of the decision notice and any payment.

###### What should I do if I disagree with your decision?
If you disagree with our decision, you can appeal it. The decision notice will have instructions on how to file an appeal. [File an appeal now](/disability-benefits/claims-appeal/).
