Do you have a disability (damage to your body or mind that makes you less able—or totally unable—to do everyday tasks, including meaningful work) that was caused by—or got worse because of—your active military service? A disability can be a physical illness (like cancer) or injury (like a painful knee injury) or a mental-health condition (like post-traumatic stress disorder, or PTSD). If yes, you may be able to get VA support (known as disability compensation or benefits). 

VA disability compensation provides financial support (monthly benefits) and other benefits like health care to help Veterans with disabilities, illnesses, or injuries caused or made worse by active military service. This includes conditions that don't appear until years after you've completed your service, but are still related to your time in the military.
