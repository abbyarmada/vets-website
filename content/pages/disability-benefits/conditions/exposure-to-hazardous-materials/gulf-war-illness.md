-	Your health problems have caused you to be disabled (meaning damage to your body or mind that makes you less able—or totally unable—to do everyday tasks in life, including meaningful work) for at least 6 months, and
-	Your health problems have been given a disability rating (measuring how severe your disability is) of 10% or more, and
-	Your health problems were not caused by anything except your service in Southwest Asia or Afghanistan, and
-	You were not dishonorably discharged from the military
