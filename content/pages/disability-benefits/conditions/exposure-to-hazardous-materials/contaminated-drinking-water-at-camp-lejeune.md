Did you serve at—or were you assigned to—Marine Corps Base Camp Lejeune or Marine Corps Air Station (MCAS) New River in North Carolina? If yes, you may have had contact with harmful chemicals (also called contaminants) in the drinking water there.

Find out if you can get VA support (known as disability compensation or benefits) for certain illnesses believed to be caused by contact with these harmful chemicals. These illnesses are known as presumptive conditions (or conditions with a presumptive service connection).

### Can I get disability benefits from VA?

- You are a U.S. Servicemember, Veterans, Reservist, or Guardsman, **and**
- You served under official orders or other official assignment at Camp Lejeune or MCAS New River for any period of time from August 1953 through December 1987, **and**
- You were discharged from the military with a condition other than dishonorable, **and**
- You have 1 or more presumptive conditions believed to be caused by contact with the harmful chemicals in the Camp Lejeune drinking water. These include:
