Did you serve at Camp Lejeune, North Carolina, for 30 days or more any time from August 1953 through December 1987? If yes, you and your family may have drank water with toxic chemicals in it (called contaminated water). If you or someone in your family has a health problem linked to this contaminated water, you may be able to get free health care and other support from the VA.
