If you served in or near Vietnam—or in certain related jobs—you may have been exposed to Agent Orange and other toxic chemicals used to clear plants and trees during the Vietnam War. Find out if you can get compensation (monthly benefits) to help with health effects caused by this exposure.

<div class="call-out" markdown="1">

### Can I get compensation?

Yes, if:

You were exposed to Agent Orange while serving in the military

#### Who's covered?

You or your dependents (family members who rely on you for financial support)
</div>

### How it works

If you have a disease that is linked to Agent Orange exposure, you can get compensation. You don't need to prove the illness began during—or became worse because of—your military service. [See the list of diseases linked to Agent Orange exposure](/disability-benefits/conditions/exposure-to-hazardous-materials/agent-orange/diseases/).

If you have a disease that's not on this list, but you believe was caused by Agent Orange exposure, you'll need to prove your illness began during—or became worse because of—your military service.
