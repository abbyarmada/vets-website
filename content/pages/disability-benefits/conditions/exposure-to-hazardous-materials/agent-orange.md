Agent Orange is a toxic chemical the U.S. military used to clear plants and trees during the Vietnam War. If you served in or near Vietnam during the Vietnam War Era—or in certain related jobs—you may have had contact with Agent Orange. Find out if you can get VA support (known as disability compensation or benefits) for health problems believed to be caused by Agent Orange.

<div class="call-out" markdown="1">

### Can I get disability compensation from VA?

Yes, if both are true:

- You came into contact with Agent Orange while serving in the military
- You have a health problem believed to be caused by Agent Orange

[See the list of Agent Orange-related health problems](/disability-benefits/conditions/exposure-to-hazardous-materials/agent-orange/diseases/).

#### Who's covered?

- Veterans
- Dependents of Veterans

</div>

### What kind of disability benefits can I get?

- Health care
- Financial support (monthly payments)

### How do I get these benefits?

You'll need to apply for benefits. 

If you have a health problem that is linked to Agent Orange, you won't need to show the problem started during—or got worse because of—your military service.[See the list of Agent Orange-related health problems](/disability-benefits/conditions/exposure-to-hazardous-materials/agent-orange/diseases/).

If you have a health problem that’s not on this list, but you believe it was caused by Agent Orange, you'll need to show the problem started during—or got worse because of—your military service.
