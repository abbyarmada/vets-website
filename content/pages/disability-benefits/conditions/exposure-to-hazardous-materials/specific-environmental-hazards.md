If you had contact with certain environmental hazards (toxic chemicals in the air, water, or soil such as those that get released from burn pits) while serving in Iraq, Afghanistan, and other areas, you may have health problems linked to these environmental hazards. Find out if you can get VA support (known as disability compensation or benefits) for these health problems.

### How do I get these benefits?

You’ll need to apply for benefits. When you apply, you’ll have to show that your health problems are linked to your contact with certain environmental hazards while serving in the military. Be sure to send in all information (such as the Burn Pit Registry) supporting your claim that you came into contact with certain environmental hazards. [Check the Burn Pit Registry] (https://veteran.mobilehealth.va.gov/AHBurnPitRegistry/ ).
