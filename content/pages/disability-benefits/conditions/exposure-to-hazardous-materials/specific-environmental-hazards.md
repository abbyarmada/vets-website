If you had contact with certain environmental hazards (harmful toxins in the air, water, or land such as those that get released from burn pits) while serving in Iraq, Afghanistan, and other areas, you may have health problems believed to be caused by these environmental hazards. Find out if you can get VA support (known as disability compensation or benefits) for these health problems.

  - A large sulfur fire at Mishraq State Sulfur Mine near Mosul, Iraq, or

### How do I get these benefits?

You’ll need to apply for benefits. When you apply, you’ll have to show that your health problems are linked to your contact with certain environmental hazards while serving in the military. Be sure to send in all information (such as the Burn Pit Registry) supporting your claim that you came into contact with certain environmental hazards. [Check the Burn Pit Registry] (https://veteran.mobilehealth.va.gov/AHBurnPitRegistry/ ).
