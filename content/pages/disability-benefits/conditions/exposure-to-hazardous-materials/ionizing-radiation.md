Find out if you can get VA support (known as disability compensation or benefits) for health problems—including some cancers—believed to be caused by contact with ionizing radiation during military service.

<div class="call-out" markdown="1">

### Can I get disability compensation from VA?

Yes, if you had contact with ionizing radiation while serving in the military through being either:
  -	Involved in atmospheric nuclear weapons testing
  -	In the postwar occupation of Hiroshima or Nagasaki
  -	A prisoner of war (POW) in Japan
  -	An x-ray technician, in a reactor plant, or in nuclear medicine or radiography (while on active duty or during active or inactive duty for training in the Reserves)
  -	Doing tasks like those of a Department of Energy (DOE) employee that make them a member of the Special Exposure Cohort ([See 42 U.S.C. 7384L(14)](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/42/7384l))
AND
-	You have a health problem on the list of those linked to radiation—or that doctors say may be caused by radiation
-	Your health problem has appeared within a certain period of time
-	You were not dishonorably discharged from the military

### How do I get these benefits?

You will need to apply for benefits.

We will ask the military branch that you served with (or the Defense Threat Reduction Agency) to give us a range of how much radiation they think you may have come into contact with—and we will use the highest level of the range they report. [See 38 CFR 3.311(b)(5) for more information](http://www.warms.vba.va.gov/regs/38CFR/BOOKB/PART3/S3_311.DOC).
