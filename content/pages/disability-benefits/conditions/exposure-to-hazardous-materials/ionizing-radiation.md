### Can I get disability compensation from VA?

Yes, if:

-	You had contact with ionizing radiation while serving in the military:
  -	As part of atmospheric nuclear weapons testing, or
  -	As part of the postwar occupation of Hiroshima or Nagasaki, or
  -	As a prisoner of war (POW) in Japan, or
  -	As an x-ray technician, in a reactor plant, or in nuclear medicine or radiography (while on active duty or during active or inactive duty for training in the Reserves)

-	You have a health problem on the list of those believed to be caused by radiation—or that doctors say may be caused by radiation, and

### How do I get these benefits?

You will need to apply for benefits.

We will ask the military branch that you served with (or the Defense Threat Reduction Agency) to give us a range of how much radiation they think you may have come into contact with—and we will use the highest level of the range they report. [See 38 CFR 3.311(b)(5) for more information](http://www.warms.vba.va.gov/regs/38CFR/BOOKB/PART3/S3_311.DOC).
