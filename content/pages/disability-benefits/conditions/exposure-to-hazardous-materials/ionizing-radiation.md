Find out if you can get disability compensation or benefits for illnesses—including some cancers—believed to be caused by contact with ionizing radiation during military service.

### Can I get disability benefits from VA?

You may be able to get disability benefits if you have an illness that's on the list of those believed to be caused by radiation—or that doctors say may be caused by radiation—and if you had contact with ionizing radiation while serving in the military by:
  -	Being part of atmospheric nuclear weapons testing, **or**
  -	Serving in the postwar occupation of Hiroshima or Nagasaki, **or**
  -	Being a prisoner of war (POW) in Japan, **or**
  -	Working as an x-ray technician, in a reactor plant, or in nuclear medicine or radiography (while on active duty or during active or inactive duty for training in the Reserves), **or**
  -	Doing tasks like those of a Department of Energy (DOE) employee that make them a member of the Special Exposure Cohort ([See 42 U.S.C. 7384L(14)](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/42/7384l))

To qualify for benefits, your illness must have appeared within a certain period of time. And you must have been discharged from the military under conditions other than dishonorable.

### How do I get these benefits?

You'll need to apply for benefits.

When you apply, we'll ask the military branch that you served with (or the Defense Threat Reduction Agency) to give us a range of how much radiation they think you may have come into contact with. We'll use the highest level of the range they report to decide on your benefits. [See 38 CFR 3.311(b)(5) for more information](http://www.warms.vba.va.gov/regs/38CFR/BOOKB/PART3/S3_311.DOC).
