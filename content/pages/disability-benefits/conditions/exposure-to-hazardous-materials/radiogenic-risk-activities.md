Radiogenic diseases are illnesses that can be caused by coming into contact with radiation. If your work while on active duty may have put you into contact with radiation, you may be at risk of radiation-related illnesses. Find out if you can get VA support (known as disability compensation or benefits) for these illnesses.

### Can I get disability compensation from VA?

Yes, if:

- You have an illness believed to be caused by radiation, and

- You were part of the postwar occupation of Hiroshima or Nagasaki, or
- You were part of atmospheric nuclear weapons testing, or

- Financial support (monthly payments)

------

### How do I get these benefits?

You’ll need to apply for benefits.

Your service records must show that you were part of 1 of the radiation risk activities described above and in 38 CFR 3.309(d)(3)(ii). And you’ll need to claim an actual illness or disability (damage to your body or mind that makes you less able—or totally unable—to do everyday tasks, including meaningful work). It’s not enough to state that you had contact with radiation during service.
