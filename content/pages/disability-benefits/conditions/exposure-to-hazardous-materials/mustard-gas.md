If you had contact with mustard gas (also known as sulfur mustard, yperite, or nitrogen mustard) or lewisite (a natural compound that contains the poison arsenic), you may have certain related long-term health problems. Find out if you can get VA support (known as disability compensation or benefits) for these health problems.

### Can I get disability compensation from VA?

Yes, if you have a disability (damage to your body or mind that makes you less able—or totally unable—to do everyday tasks, including meaningful work) believed to be caused by contact with mustard gas or lewisite **and** your military record shows you had contact with mustard gas or lewisite at one of the following:
 - During field or chamber testing
 - The German air raid on the harbor of Bari, Italy, in World War II
 - While disposing of or handling explosive ordinance (high-explosive devices and chemical and nuclear weapons) during Operation Iraqi Freedom
  - While making or handling vesicant (blistering) agents during military service

-----

### How do I get these benefits?

You’ll need to apply for benefits.

Contact with mustard gas or lewisite is not defined as a service condition (an illness or injury caused by service in the military). So you’ll need to apply based on the health problem believed to be caused by your contact with 1 of these chemicals. When you send in your claim, be sure to share any military records that show you had contact with blistering agents.
