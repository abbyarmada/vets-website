If you served on a Blue Water Navy ship on the coastal or inland waterways of Vietnam between January 9, 1962, and May 7, 1975—or you ever came ashore in Vietnam—you likely had contact with Agent Orange (a toxic chemical used to clear trees and plants during the war). Find out if you can get VA support (known as disability compensation or benefits) for health problems believed to be caused by contact with Agent Orange.

### Can I get disability compensation from VA?

Yes, if you have 1 or more health problems linked to Agent Orange:
  - Your military record shows that you were aboard 1 of the U.S. Navy and Coast Guard ships that entered Vietnam’s inland waterways
  OR
  - You came ashore in Vietnam

### How do I get these benefits?

You’ll need to apply for benefits. When you apply, you’ll have to show that you were aboard 1 of the U.S. Navy and Coast Guard ships that entered Vietnam’s inland waterways. If your ship docked or landed crewmembers, you'll have to show that you went ashore.

Check the list of U.S. Navy and Coast Guard ships linked to service in Vietnam to find out if your service aboard a ship means you likely had contact with Agent Orange. [See the list of ships that had contact with Agent Orange](http://www.publichealth.va.gov/exposures/agentorange/shiplist/list.asp).

If you didn’t go ashore or serve aboard a ship that entered the inland waterways of Vietnam, you’ll have to show that you had contact with Agent Orange in another way while serving in the military. We decide these claims on a case-by-case basis.

**Exception:**
If you’re a Blue Water Veteran with non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma (a type of cancer of the lymph glands and other lymphatic tissue—a part of the body’s immune system that helps to fight infection and illness), you don’t need to show where you came into contact with Agent Orange.

We believe that non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma can be caused by contact with Agent Orange through service in Vietnam or its offshore waters during the Vietnam Era.
