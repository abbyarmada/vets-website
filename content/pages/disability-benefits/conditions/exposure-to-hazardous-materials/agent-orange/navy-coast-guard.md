If you served on a Navy or Coast Guard ship in or around Vietnam during the Vietnam War Era, you may have had contact with Agent Orange (a toxic chemical used to clear trees and plants during the war). Find out if you can get VA support (known as disability compensation or benefits) for health problems believed to be caused by Agent Orange.

### Can I get disability compensation from VA?

Yes, if:

### How do I get these benefits?

You'll need to apply for benefits.

If you served on 1 of the ships or boats listed above—and you have 1 or more health problems believed to be caused by Agent Orange—we'll conclude that your health problem is likely caused by contact with Agent Orange.

Don’t have an Agent Orange–related disability (damage to your body or mind that makes you less able—or totally unable—to do everyday life tasks, including meaningful work) at this time? You and your family can still be part of the Agent Orange Health Registry.
