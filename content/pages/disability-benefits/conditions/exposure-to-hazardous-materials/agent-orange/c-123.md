If you flew on—or worked with—C-123 aircraft in Vietnam or other locations, you may have had contact with Agent Orange (a toxic chemical used to clear trees and plants during the Vietnam War). C-123 aircraft sprayed Agent Orange during the war. The planes still had traces of the chemical in them while they were being used, up until 1986.

Find out if you can get VA support (known as disability compensation or benefits) for health problems believed to be caused by contact with Agent Orange through a C-123 aircraft.
