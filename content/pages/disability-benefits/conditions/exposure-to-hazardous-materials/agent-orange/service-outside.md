### How do I get these benefits?

You'll need to apply for benefits. When you apply, you'll have to show that you had contact with Agent Orange while serving in the military.

**Exception:**<br>
If you’re a Blue Water Veteran with non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma, you don't need to show that you had contact with Agent Orange. We recognize non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma as related to service in Vietnam or its offshore waters during the Vietnam Era.
