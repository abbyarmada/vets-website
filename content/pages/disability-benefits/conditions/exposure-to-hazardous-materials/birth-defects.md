Spina bifida is a birth defect of the spinal cord that happens when a baby is still in the womb. In some cases, it can be caused by a parent's past contact with certain chemicals—like Agent Orange. If you served in South Vietnam or the Republic of Korea—and your child has spina bifida or certain other birth defects—he or she may be able to get support from the VA.
