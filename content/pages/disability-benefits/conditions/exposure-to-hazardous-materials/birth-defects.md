Spina bifida is a birth defect of the spinal cord that happens when a baby is still in the womb. In some cases, it can be caused by a parent's past contact with certain chemicals (like Agent Orange). If you served in South Vietnam or the Republic of Korea—and your child has spina bifida or certain other birth defects—your child may be able to get support from the VA (known as disability compensation or benefits).

### Can my child get disability compensation from VA?

### For Spina Bifida

Yes, if:
  - The child's biological mother or father served in:
    - South Vietnam (the Republic of Vietnam) any time from January 9, 1962, through May 7, 1975, or
    - The Korean Demilitarized Zone (DMZ) any time from April 1, 1968, through August 31, 1971, and
  - The child was conceived after the parent served in either South Vietnam or the Republic of Korea, and
  - The child was diagnosed with a form of spina bifida other than spina bifida occulta

### For Other Birth Defects

Yes, if:
  - The child's biological mother served in South Vietnam any time from January 9, 1962, through May 7, 1975, and
  - The child was conceived after the mother served in South Vietnam, and
  - The child has a covered birth defect that caused a permanent physical or mental disability. (A disability is damage to a person’s body or mind that makes them less able—or totally unable—to do everyday tasks in life, including meaningful work. A permanent disability is one that does not go away.)

### How do I get these benefits for my child?

You'll need to apply for benefits for your child. When you apply, you’ll have to show that your contact with certain chemicals while serving in the military likely caused your child’s birth defect. 

We provide financial support at 1 of 3 disability levels. Your child's level will depend on how severe the disability is.
