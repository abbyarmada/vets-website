Spina bifida is a birth defect of the spinal cord that happens when a baby is still in the womb. In some cases, it can be caused by a parent's past contact with certain chemicals (like Agent Orange). If you served in South Vietnam or the Republic of Korea—and your child has spina bifida or certain other birth defects—your child may be able to get support from the VA (known as disability compensation or benefits).

Yes, if:

  - The child's biological mother or father served in:
    - South Vietnam (the Republic of Vietnam) any time from January 9, 1962 - May 7, 1975, or
    - The Korean Demilitarized Zone (DMZ) any time from April 1, 1968 - August 31, 1971, and

  - The child has a covered birth defect that caused a permanent physical or mental disability (a disability is damage to a person’s body or mind that makes them less able—or totally unable—to do everyday life tasks, including meaningful work; a permanent disability is one that does not go away)

### How do I get these benefits for my child?

You'll need to apply for benefits for your child. When you apply, you’ll need to show that your child’s birth defect was likely caused by your contact with certain chemicals while serving in the military. 

We provide financial support at 1 of 3 disability levels. Your child's level will depend on how severe his or her disability is.
