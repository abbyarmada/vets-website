Asbestos is a group of fibers that were once used in many buildings and products, but are now known to be toxic. If you served in Iraq or other countries in the Middle East and Southeast Asia, you may have had contact with asbestos as it was released into the air when old buildings were damaged. Or, you may have had contact with asbestos if you worked in certain jobs or settings (like shipyards, construction, or vehicle repair). 

Find out if you can get VA support (known as compensation) for health problems believed to be caused by asbestos.
