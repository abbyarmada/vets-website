Asbestos is a group of fibers that were once used in many buildings and products, but are now known to cause health problems. If you served in Iraq or other countries in the Middle East and Southeast Asia, you may have had contact with asbestos as it was released into the air when old buildings were damaged. Or, you may have had contact with asbestos if you worked in certain jobs or settings (like shipyards, construction, or vehicle repair). 

Find out if you can get VA support (known as disability compensation or benefits) for health problems believed to be caused by asbestos.

### How do I get these benefits?

You'll need to apply for benefits. When you apply, youâ€™ll have to show that your health problems were likely caused by your contact with asbestos while serving in the military.

- Shipyards
- Construction
- Carpentry
- Demolition (knocking down old buildings) 

Get tested if you've made or worked with products like:
