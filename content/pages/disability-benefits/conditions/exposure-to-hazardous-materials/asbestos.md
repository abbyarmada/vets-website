Asbestos is a fiber that was once used in many buildings and products, but is now known to be toxic. If you served in Iraq or other countries in the Middle East and Southeast Asia, you may have had contact with asbestos as it was released into the air when old buildings were damaged. You may have also had contact with asbestos if you worked in certain jobs or settingsâ€”like shipyards, construction, or vehicle repair. You may be able to get a monthly payment (called compensation) and care for health problems linked to asbestos.
