#### Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) Basics

Post-traumatic stress can happen after someone goes through a traumatic event such as combat, an assault, or a disaster. Most people have some stress reactions following trauma. If the reactions don’t go away over time or they disrupt your life, you may have PTSD. [Learn more about PTSD](http://www.ptsd.va.gov/public/index.asp).

If you have symptoms of PTSD and suffered a serious injury or sexual violation, or were threatened with injury, sexual violation, or death while serving in the military, you may be able to get VA support (known as disability compensation or benefits).

### How do I get these benefits?

You’ll need to apply for benefits. We want to make sure you know that the screening process for disability compensation is geared toward getting a full understanding of your PTSD, not treating it.

To get help or treatment, contact your health care provider or any of the emergency contacts listed at the top of this page. 

At VA, we’ve made great progress in PTSD treatments and have brought more mental health providers to VA medical centers to help provide the best care to Veterans with post-traumatic stress. [Learn more about our PTSD programs]( http://www.mentalhealth.va.gov/PTSD.asp).
