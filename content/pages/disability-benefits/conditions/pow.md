### Can I get disability benefits from VA?
You may be able to get disability benefits if you have a current illness or injury (known as a condition) that affects your body or mind and:
-	Your condition is believed to be caused by time spent as a POW (called a presumptive disability), **and**
-	At any time following active-duty service, your condition has become at least 10% disabling. Our disability rating system is used to measure the severity of your disability.


### What conditions are covered by these benefits?

Conditions believed to be caused by time spent as a POW are covered by these benefits. Please see the list of covered conditions below. We've decided these conditions based on studies of the long-term effects of captivity, deprivation (a lack of things such as sleep that people need for their physical and mental well-being), trauma (an injury or deeply disturbing experience), and cold injury. 

**For former POWs held captive for any length of time:**

**Conditions that affect your body, including:**
-	Osteoporosis (brittle bones) (for claims filed on or after October 10, 2008, and you have a diagnosis of post-traumatic stress (PTSD))
-	Lasting damage from frostbite
-	Post-traumatic osteoarthritis (pain and swelling in your joints that happens when a past injury causes a joint—such as your knee or elbow—to wear out)
-	A stroke (a “brain attack” that happens when blood flow to an area of your brain is cut off, causing brain cells to die) or problems (such as memory loss, loss of speech, or weakness in an arm or leg) caused by a stroke
-	Hypertensive vascular disease (problems with your veins and arteries—also called blood vessels—caused by high blood pressure), including hypertensive heart disease (damage to your heart caused by high blood pressure), and related problems (such as stroke, blood clots, or other serious issues)

**Conditions that affect your mind, including:**
-	A neuropsychiatric condition (a condition related to your brain or nervous system)
-	Psychosis (symptoms of mental illness that result in unusual thinking, actions, or feelings, or seeing or hearing strange things)
-	Dysthymic disorder (a long-lasting mental illness—sometimes called depressive neurosis—that may cause you to lose interest in daily life, to lose your drive to do normal, everyday tasks, and to feel hopeless or lack self-esteem)
-	Any of the anxiety states (such as PTSD)

**For former POWs held captive for 30 days or more:**

**Problems that affect your body, including:**
-	Osteoporosis (brittle bones) (for claims filed on or after September 28, 2009; no PTSD diagnosis is required)
-	Helminthiasis (an infection with parasitic worms, such as roundworms, whipworms, or hookworms)
-	Peripheral neuropathy (damage to the nerves that carry messages to your brain and spinal cord from the rest of your body), except where directly related to an illness caused by an infection
-	Peptic ulcer disease (painful sores—also called ulcers—in your stomach or small intestine)
-	Chronic dysentery (a long-lasting swelling of your stomach and small intestine—caused by infection—that leads to diarrhea with blood and other symptoms)
-	Irritable bowel syndrome (a long-lasting illness that affects your large intestine—also known as your colon—and causes symptoms like cramping, stomach pain, bloating, gas, diarrhea, and constipation)
-	Cirrhosis of the liver (the end result of a buildup of scar tissue—called fibrosis—on your liver that makes it hard for your liver to function the way it should)

**Any nutritional deficiency (when your body can’t absorb enough of the vitamins and minerals—called nutrients—it needs to function well), including:**
-	Avitaminosis (when your body doesn’t have enough of a certain vitamin it needs)
-	Beriberi (when your body doesn’t have enough thiamine, also known as vitamin B1), including beriberi heart disease (when the lack of vitamin B1 affects your heart)
-	Malnutrition (when your body doesn’t get enough nutrients—like proteins carbs, fats, vitamins, and minerals), including optic atrophy (the loss of nerve fibers in your optic nerve, which carries images from your inner eye to your brain, that can lead to vision problems) connected to malnutrition, or
-	Pellagra (when your body doesn't get enough of a B complex vitamin called niacin or an amino acid called tryptophan)
