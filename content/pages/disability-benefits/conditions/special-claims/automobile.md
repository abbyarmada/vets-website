### How do I get these benefits?

You'll need to apply for benefits and get our approval *before* buying a vehicle or adaptive equipment. You can apply for—and use—either grant before or after military discharge.

For the 1-time payment to help you buy a specially equipped vehicle, we'll pay the vehicle's seller directly. For the adaptive-equipment grant, we may pay you or we may pay the seller of the equipment directly.  

When you apply, you'll need to show that your disability is service connected or is treated as if service connected under 38 U.S.C. 1151. [Learn more about 38 U.S.C. 1151](/disability-benefits/conditions/special-claims/title-38-USC-1151/).

You'll also need to complete VA Form 21-4502: Application for Automobile or Other Conveyance and Adaptive Equipment.
[Download VA Form 21-4502](http://www.vba.va.gov/pubs/forms/VBA-21-4502-ARE.pdf). 

If you qualify for adaptive equipment only (for example, you have a service-connected disability due to ankylosis of the knees or hips), you should complete VA Form 10-1394: Application for Adaptive Equipment—Motor Vehicle.
