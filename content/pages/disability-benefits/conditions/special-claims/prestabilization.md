Did you recently end your active military service? And do you have a disability (damage to your body or mind that makes you less able—or totally unable—to do everyday tasks, including meaningful work) that is related to your military service (called a service-connected disability)? You may be able to get temporary VA support (known as disability compensation or benefits) right away.

If you qualify for this support, you will get a special disability rating known as a prestabilization rating. Your prestabilization rating may be 50% or 100%, depending on the severity of your disability. This rating will continue for 1 year after your discharge from active service.

### Can I get disability compensation from VA?
Yes, if:
- You've recently ended your active military service, and
- You have a severe service-connected disability that is unstable (meaning an illness or injury that is changing in nature or hasn't yet been fully treated), and
- Your disability is expected to continue for an unknown amount of time

### Who's covered?
Veterans
</div>

### What kind of benefits can I get?

- Health care
- Financial support (monthly payments)

### How do I get these benefits?

You'll need to apply for benefits. When you apply, you'll need to show that you have a severe, service-connected disability that is unstable and expected to continue for an unknown amount of time. This information will normally be part of your Service Treatment Record.

[Apply for benefits](https://www.vets.gov/disability-benefits/apply-for-benefits/).

**Example**<br>
While in active service, a Servicemember was diagnosed with Hodgkin’s disease and began chemotherapy that continued during and after her medical discharge process. She continued to get treatment through her local VA medical center, and we gave her a prestabilization rating of 100% for 1 year from her date of discharge.
