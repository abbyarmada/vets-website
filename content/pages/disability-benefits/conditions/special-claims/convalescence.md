Are you recovering from surgery or a disability related to your military service that's left you unable to move (called an immobilizing  disability)? You may be able to get a temporary 100% disability rating and VA support (known as disability compensation or benefits).

<div class="call-out" markdown="1">

### Can I get disability compensation from VA?

Yes, if:

  -	You've had a surgery or other treatment performed at a VA hospital or an approved hospital or outpatient center for a disability related to your military service (called a service-connected disability), and
  -	The surgery required a recovery time of at least 1 month, or
  -	Reports show that the surgery or treatment was for a service-connected disability, and
  -	The surgery resulted in severe issues, such as:
      - Surgical wounds that haven't healed all the way
      - Stumps of recent amputations
      - Being unable to move due to being put in splints or casts to help with healing (known as therapeutic immobilizations)
      - Being unable to leave your house (known as house confinement)
      - Being required to use a wheelchair or crutches, or
  -	1 major joint or more was immobilized by a cast without surgery

### How do I get these benefits?

You'll need to apply for benefits. 

A temporary 100% rating is for recovery time from surgery or immobilization of a joint by a cast without surgery for a service-connected disability. The temporary 100% rating may continue for 1 to 3 monthsâ€”depending on your unique case. You may be able to get an extension for up to 3 more months if your case is severe.

**Example:** A Veteran had a left knee injury that resulted in a 30% disability rating. As the knee problem got worse, the Veteran's VA doctor recommended surgery to stop further damage. Since the success of the surgery wouldn't be known for 3 months after the Veteran's 1-week stay in the hospital, we granted the Veteran a temporary 100% disability rating for 3 months.
