Do you have a disability (damage to your mind or body that makes you less able—or totally unable—to do everyday tasks, including meaningful work)? If yes, is your disability related to your service in the military (called a service-connected disability)?

If you can't work because of this disability, you may qualify for a designation called individual unemployability. This means you may be able to get VA support (known as disability compensation or benefits) at the same level as a Veteran who has a disability rated at 100% disabling (our rating system for measuring how severe your disability is).

<div class="call-out" markdown="1">

### Can I get disability compensation from VA?
Yes, if:

  - You have at least 1 service-connected disability rated at 60% or more disabling, or 2 or more service-connected disabilities (with at least 1 rated at 40% or more disabling and a combined rating of 70% or more), and
  - You can't hold down a steady job that supports you financially (known as substantially gainful employment) because of your service-connected disability. Odd jobs (known as marginal employment) don't count.

**Note:** In exceptional cases (like needing to be in the hospital often), you may be able to qualify at a lower disability rating.



### Who's covered?
Veterans

### What kind of benefits can I get?

- Health care
- Financial support (monthly payments)

### How do I get these benefits?

You'll need to apply for benefits. When you apply, you'll have to provide evidence (like statements from your doctor or hospital reports) showing that your disability is preventing you from holding down a steady job. We'll also review your work and education history.

[Apply for benefits](https://www.vets.gov/disability-benefits/apply-for-benefits/).

**Example**<br>
A Veteran has a service-connected heart condition and a 60% disability rating. She was still able to work until last year, when she began to get chest pain when doing anything physical (like walking or lifting boxes). Her doctor told her to retire as soon as possible. She filed a claim for more disability compensation. We reviewed the Veteran’s work and education history and agreed that she was individually unemployable (unable to work) due to her service-connected disability. So we increased her disability compensation to the same rate as a 100% disabled Veteran.
