Did you suffer an added disability (damage to your body or mind that makes you less able—or totally unable—to do everyday tasks, including meaningful work) while receiving VA medical care or taking part in a VA program designed to help you find, get, or keep a job? If yes, you may be able to get VA support (known as disability compensation or benefits).

### Can I get disability compensation from VA?
Yes, if:

- You have an added disability resulting from:
  - VA hospital care, or
  - VA medical or surgical treatment, or
  - A VA health exam, or
  - A VA vocational rehabilitation course (under 38 U.S.C. Chapter 31), or
  - VA compensated work therapy (under 38 U.S.C. 1718)
  
  
### Who's covered?
Veterans
</div>

### What kind of benefits can I get?

Financial support (monthly payments)

-----

### How do I get these benefits?

You'll need to apply for benefits. When you apply, you'll need to show that the additional disability happened because of VA medical care or a VA program designed to help you find, get, or keep a job. The additional disability can't be a reasonably expected result or complication of treatment.

We'll award any compensation payments in the same way we would if your disability was related to your military service (called a service-connected disability).
