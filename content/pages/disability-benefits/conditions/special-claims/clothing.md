Has your clothing been damaged by your prosthetic or orthopedic device (such as a wheelchair) or by the medicine youâ€™re taking for a skin condition? If yes, you may be able to get money each year to help you buy new clothes (a disability compensation benefit known as an annual clothing allowance).

<div class="call-out" markdown="1">

### Can I get disability compensation from VA?

Yes, if:

  - Your prosthetic or orthopedic device or your skin medicine causes damage to your clothes, and
  - You need this device or skin medicine because of an injury or illness related to your military service (called a service-connected condition)



### Who's covered?
Veterans
</div>

### What benefits can I get?

A 1-time or yearly payment for buying new clothes

### How do I get these benefits?

You'll need to apply for benefits.

To get your yearly payment, you'll need to qualify by August 1 of that year. You may be able to get more than 1 annual clothing allowance if you have more than 1 prosthetic or orthopedic device, or skin medicine and/or it affects more than 1 type of clothing garment.
