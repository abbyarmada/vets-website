Did you spend time in a VA hospital or other VA-approved hospital for a disability related to your military service (called a service-connected disability)? If yes, you may be able to get added VA support (known as disability compensation or benefits) with a temporary 100% disability rating during your hospital stay.

<div class="call-out" markdown="1">

### Can I get disability compensation from VA?

Yes, if:
  - You spent more than 21 days in a VA hospital or other approved hospital for a service-connected disability, or
  - You were under hospital observation for more than 21 days at VA expense for a service-connected disability

### Who's covered?
Veterans
</div>

### What kind of benefits can I get?

- Health care
- Added financial support (payments) for the time you spent in the hospital

-----

### How do I get these benefits?

You'll need to apply for benefits. If you weren't in a VA hospital, give us your hospital discharge summary showing the length and cause of your hospital stay when filing your claim.

**Example:** A Veteran with a 40% service-connected disability rating for diabetes had to stay in a VA hospital after going into a diabetic coma. He needed to stay in the hospital for 25 days due to the coma and related infections. We temporarily raised his rating to 100% during his hospital stay. After he got out of the hospital, his disability rating went back to 40%.
