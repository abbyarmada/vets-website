Do you have a disability caused by an illnesss or injury that happened—or got worse—while you were actively serving in the military? If yes, you may be able to get VA support (called disability compensation or benefits)—no matter when or where you served. 

###Can I get compensation?

Yes, if:

- You have a current physical or mental disability (damage to your body or mind that makes you less able—or totally unable—to do everyday tasks, including meaningful work), and
- You got injured or sick while actively serving in the military—and your injury or illness caused your disability or made a disability you already had worse, and 
- You can link your current disability to an injury or illness that happened while you were actively serving in the military
