Do you need help filing a disability compensation claim? You may want to work with an accredited representative—a professional trained in the claims process who we trust to help you with VA-related needs.

Most accredited representatives work for Veterans Service Organizations (VSOs). These private nonprofit groups advocate on behalf of Veterans and Servicemembers as well as their dependents and survivors. VSOs may also work for state or county governments.

### What does it take to be an accredited representative?
Accredited representatives need to:
  - Pass an exam
  - Pass a background check
  - Keep taking required education courses to make sure they're providing the most up-to-date information

Recognized organizations and individuals can legally represent a Veteran, Servicemember, dependent, or survivor before VA. Non-recognized organizations and individuals can provide information, but cannot be representatives.

### What does an accredited representative do?

Accredited representatives help you understand and apply for VA benefits, like:

- Financial support (monthly payments)
- Education
- Vocational rehabilitation and employment (job training, job searches, and more)
- Home loans
- Life insurance
- Pension
- Health care
- Burial benefits

Accredited representatives can also help you gather supporting documents (like doctor or hospital reports) and can file a claim on your behalf.

#### Does it cost money to use an accredited representative?

Many VSOs provide their services free of charge. But they may ask you to pay them back for unusual expenses. Unlike VSOs, VA-accredited claims agents and attorneys may charge for their services. If you believe you were charged an unreasonable fee by a claims agent or attorney, read our guide on how to challenge a fee. [Download our "How to Challenge a Fee" guide](http://www.va.gov/OGC/docs/Accred/HowtoChallengeaFee.pdf).
