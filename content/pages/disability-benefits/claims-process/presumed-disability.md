A presumed disability is a disability that has been diagnosed by a doctor and that we consider to be related to a Veteranâ€™s military service because of specific aspects of service. This usually applies to illnesses caused by contact with certain harmful chemicals or other dangers or a chronic (long-lasting) illness that appears within 1 year after discharge.
