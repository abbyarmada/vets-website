<div class="call-out" markdown="1">

Already getting disability benefits but think you may now qualify for more? Find out by filing a new claim.

When you file a new claim, you may get:
- More financial support 
- Special monthly payments
- A shift to Individual Unemployability status (a status given to Veterans who are unable to work because of a disability)

[Learn more about Individual Unemployability](/disability-benefits/conditions/special-claims/individual-unemployability/).
