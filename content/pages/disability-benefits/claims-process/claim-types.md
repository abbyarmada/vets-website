Disability benefits claims (also called disability compensation claims) can be based on any of 3 types of disabilities (damage to your body or mind that makes you less able—or totally unable—to do everyday tasks, including meaningful work):

1. Disabilities that were there before you started serving in the military but got worse because of your service
2. Disabilities that happened while you were serving in the military
3. Disabilities that arose after you ended your military service
