For each disability benefits claim, we assign a severity rating from 0% to 100% in 10% increments (for example, 10%, 20%, 30%). We base this rating on the evidence (supporting documents like a doctor's report or medical test results) you provide as well as other information we may get from other sources (like federal agencies). 

See the Combined Ratings page to learn how we calculate disability percentage for more than one disability. [See Combined Ratings](http://www.benefits.va.gov/COMPENSATION/rates-index.asp#combined).

### You may be paid added amounts—in certain instances—if:

-	You have very severe disabilities or loss of limb(s)
-	You have a spouse, child(ren), or dependent parent(s)
-	You have a seriously disabled spouse
